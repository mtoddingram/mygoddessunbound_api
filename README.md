🌙 MyGoddessUnbound API
A dark engine for cosmic revelations

MyGoddessUnbound is more than code; it is the beating heart of a ritual.
Forged from the mathematics of the heavens and the mythos of a deity unchained, this API whispers secrets of the sky into the ears of an AI oracle. It is the unseen machinery that powers MyGoddessUnbound Horoscope readings—feeding them with celestial truth and a touch of nocturnal allure.

🔮 What it does

In the hushed hours when stars wheel overhead, MyGoddessUnbound calls upon modern astronomy to interpret their dance. Built on Skyfield
 and the JPL DE421 ephemeris, it computes the positions of the Sun, Moon, and planets with scientific precision. From these raw coordinates it weaves a natal chart:

Ecliptic positions for every major body – longitudes of the Sun, Moon, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune and Pluto are calculated to a fraction of a degree.

Ascendant & Midheaven – the rising sign and the highest point in the chart, calculated from the time and location you provide.

House system (Placidus) – the chart is divided into twelve houses, mapping the sky’s rotation onto your birth horizon. Each cusp is calculated using refined trigonometric formulas.

The result is delivered as a structured JSON payload that reveals the bones of a birth chart—longitudes, axes and houses—ready to be interpreted by a higher power.

🌑 The dark heart of your horoscope

On its own, MyGoddessUnbound is a machine of numbers. Coupled with our Agentic AI, those numbers become poetry. The API feeds its calculations directly into the MyGoddessUnbound Horoscope system. There, an intelligent agent interprets the angles and patterns, casting them into words that seduce and empower. Every reading you receive is grounded in this engine’s precision and then wrapped in the darkly sensual voice of the goddess unleashed.

⚙️ A modern yet mystical stack

Python 3 & Flask – a lightweight web service that responds to your requests with speed and grace.

Skyfield & NumPy – for high‑fidelity astronomical computations.

pytz – to ensure that time zones and daylight saving rules are honoured, because even a minute’s difference can tilt a chart.

While the technical details are modern, the ambience is timeless: think velvet night, candle‑lit altars and the hum of distant planets.

🪐 Beyond the horizon

MyGoddessUnbound is a living project. Future enhancements will delve deeper into the occult mechanics of the cosmos—calculating aspects between planets, experimenting with alternative house systems, and charting points such as Chiron and the Lunar Nodes. Transits and progressions may follow, allowing the same engine that illuminates your nativity to forecast the tides of your life.
